Poinsettia-Shape Fruit Bread
    ####
    3 1/4 - 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
    2 packages active dry yeast
    3/4 cup milk
    1/3 cup butter or margarine
    1/3 cup granulated sugar
    1 teaspoon salt
    2 eggs
    3/4 cup golden raisins
    3/4 cup dried cranberries
    2 teaspoons finely shredded lemon peel
    1 egg white, slightly beaten
    1 tablespoon water
    Coarse sugar
    ####
    In a large mixing bowl combine 1-1/2 cups of the flour and the yeast. In a medium saucepan heat and stir milk, butter, granulated sugar, and salt until warm (120 degree F to 130 degree F) and butter almost melts. Add milk mixture to flour mixture along with the eggs. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Stir in raisins, dried cranberries, lemon peel, and as much of the remaining flour as you can.
    Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (3 to 5 minutes total). Shape into a ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl; turn once. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double (1-1/2 to 2 hours).
    Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough into thirds. Cover; let rest for 10 minutes. Grease 3 baking sheets.
    Roll each portion of dough into an 8-inch square. Carefully transfer one of the squares to one of the baking sheets, reshaping as necessary. Using a sharp knife, cut 4-inch slits from the corner to within 1/2-inch of the center of the square. Fold every other point to the center to form a pinwheel. Use water to moisten points of dough in center and press to seal. Repeat with remaining squares and baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double (about 50 minutes). Place 2 of the baking sheets, covered, in the refrigerator while the first loaf bakes.
    Stir together egg white and water. Before baking, lightly brush mixture over loaf. Sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake, one loaf at a time, in a 325 degree F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden. Transfer pinwheel to wire rack and let cool. Repeat with remaining baking sheets from refrigerator. (Store egg white mixture, covered, in refrigerator when not in use.) Store loaves in airtight containers at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Makes 3 pinwheel loaves.

Remove from grill and allow to cool.

    Make a lengthwise cut into the side of each steak, cutting to, but not through the opposite side (it will open like a book). Brush the outsides of the steaks with olive oil; sprinkle the insides and outsides of steaks with the seasoning mixture.
    When vegetables are cool enough to handle, remove onion slices from skewers. Cut the grilled onion slices in half. Cut the mushroom and pepper into think strips.
    With the first steak "opened", place two slices of cheese on bottom half of steak, staggering the slices so they cover the surface. Layer with half of the vegetables and two more slices of cheese. Close the top half of the steak over cheese and vegetables. Tie together at 2-inch intervals with clean kitchen string. Repeat with the remaining steak, cheese and vegetables.
    Place stuffed steaks on the grill. Grill for 14 to 16 minutes or until desired doneness, turning once halfway through grilling. Remove steaks from grill. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes.
    Brush the cut sides of the buns with butter. Place buns, cut sides down, on the grill. Grill for 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly toasted.

(For chewier cookies bake slightly shorter; for crisper ones, bake slightly longer.) Let cool 5 minutes to firm up. Using a spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack.

    1 tablespoon  cooking oil

    2 cups  salsa
    2 cups  chicken or vegetable broth

Fresh Pasta Dough for Ravioli
    ####
    1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
    2 eggs
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    1 - 2 tablespoons water (optional)
    1 egg, lightly beaten
    1 tablespoon water
    ####
    In a food processor, combine flour, 2 eggs, and salt. Cover and process until well mixed. If necessary, with processor running, add 1 to 2 tablespoons water through feed tube until mixture forms a dough. Remove dough and shape into a ball.* On a lightly floured surface, knead dough about 1 minute or until smooth. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and let stand for 30 minutes.
    Divide dough into four portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion into a 12-inch square. (If using a pasta machine, pass each portion through machine according to the manufacturer's directions until dough is 1/16 inch thick.)
    To shape ravioli, in a small bowl, combine 1 egg and 1 tablespoon water; set aside. Cut rolled dough into 2-inch-wide strips. Brush strips lightly with egg mixture. Leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges, place about 1 teaspoon of filling at 1-inch intervals on one strip of dough. Lay a second strip of dough, brushed side down, over the first. Using your fingers, press the dough around each mound of filling so that the two moistened strips stick together. Cut dough between filling to make individual ravioli. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
    To cook ravioli, in a Dutch oven, bring a large amount of salted water to boiling. Gently drop about one-fourth of the ravioli, one at a time, into the boiling water and stir to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Simmer gently for 3 to 4 minutes or until tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer ravioli to a serving dish.

    1 teaspoon  snipped fresh thyme or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
    1/4 teaspoon  salt
    1/4 teaspoon  black pepper
    1 cup  water
    1/3 cup  cold water
    2 tablespoons  flour
    Fresh whole tart red cherries (optional)
    Fresh thyme sprigs (optional)
    ####
    Prepare Cherry and Wild Rice Stuffing; set aside. Trim fat from pork. Butterfly the meat by making a lengthwise cut down the center of the meat, cutting to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Spread open. Place knife in the V of the first cut. Cut horizontally to the cut surface and away from the first cut to within 1/2 inch of the other side of the meat. Repeat on opposite side of the V. Spread these sections open. Cover the roast with plastic wrap. Working from center (thicker part) to edges, pound with flat side of a meat mallet until meat is 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Make sure the meat is a uniform thickness. Remove plastic wrap. Set meat aside.
    Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Spread the stuffing over the surface of the butterflied roast. Roll loin into a spiral, beginning with a short side. Tie meat with clean 100 percent cotton heavy kitchen string. (Wrap several strands of string crosswise around the meat and tie securely.) Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Sprinkle with thyme, salt, and pepper. Insert an ovenproof meat thermometer in center of roast. Roast, uncovered, for 1 3/4 to 2-1/4 hours or until thermometer registers 155 degrees F, covering ends of meat after 45 minutes to keep rice moist. Transfer meat to a serving platter. Cover loosely with foil and let stand 15 minutes before carving. (The temperature of the roast after standing should be 160 degrees F.)
    For pan gravy: Add 1 cup water to pan, scraping up browned bits. In a small saucepan whisk together the 1/3 cup cold water and the flour. Whisk in pan juices. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 1 minute more.

Place in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease surface. Cover; let rise in a warm place until double in size (1 to 1 1/2 hours).
