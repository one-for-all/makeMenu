This is a Flask project, dedicated to show recipes of food that you can make based on what you have as ingredients.

After installing Flask and all othe rnecessary libraries, run
	$ python database_setup.py
	$ python add_recipes
	$ python add_ingredients
	$ python add_description

to set up the database. To run the actual program, just do
	$ python makeMenu

The crawler is dedicated to populate our recipe, due to time constraint, we have not parsed the file to populate our database.
